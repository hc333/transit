# Welcome to Transit!

Welcome to TRANSIT: an app that tracks the CTTransit buses in Connecticut, a project created for the class ASTR 330.

The main app is run through Streamlit at the following link: https://share.streamlit.io/hc333/transit/main/app.py

Features include...

In the main body:

-A map displaying the latitude and longitude of the current running CTTransit buses

-A table showing the names and neighborhoods of the running CTTransit buses in New Haven

-A textbar to show the schedule of whichever CTTransit bus you wish

In the sidebar:

-A button to show a particular bus on the map

-A button to show a particular stop on the map

-A textbox to find out which stop a bus is supposed to be at next

-A textbox to find out which stop a bus is actually approaching next

-A visual demonstrating the speed and direction of a bus

And in the Learn about Transit Jupyter Notebook, you can view an earlier iteration of the app run through matplotlib.

Thanks for viewing!
