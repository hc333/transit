# Welcome to Transit!

Welcome to TRANSIT: an app that tracks the CTTransit buses in Connecticut, a project created for the class ASTR 330.

The main app is run through Streamlit at the following link: https://share.streamlit.io/hc333/transit/main/app.py

Currently the web app is under construction, but the app can still be run from a local machine.

The app is primarily run through the file app.py, with some help from functions.py.

The code also makes use of txt files and realtime bus location data from the CTTransit website. You can find out more here: https://www.cttransit.com/about/developers

Features of the app include...

-A map displaying the latitude and longitude of the current running CTTransit buses

-A table showing the names and neighborhoods of the running CTTransit buses in New Haven

-A textbar to show the schedule of whichever CTTransit bus you wish

An in the sidebar you'll find:

-A button to show a particular bus on the map

-A button to show a particular stop on the map

-A textbox to find out which stop a bus is supposed to be at next

-A textbox to find out which stop a bus is actually approaching next

-A visual demonstrating the speed and direction of a bus


In the 'Learn about TRANSIT' Jupyter Notebook, you can view an earlier iteration of the app run through matplotlib.

Thanks for viewing!
